                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence is about to change every industry - and the software industry is first. With AI the software building cycle is 10x shorter, 100x cheaper and operations can be nearly completely automated.</p>
                        <p>This new reality opens up an opportunity: building single-value digital products, often for niche markets, that in the past would not have been viable businesses on its own. We believe that the AI revolution in the software industry is a new dawn for independent digital products, that can successfully compete with products from large companies.</p>
                        <p><span style="font-family: 'Rubik Mono One', sans-serif;">TAG|85</span> is our attempt to prove this hypothesis - and to be a leader for single-value digital products.</p>
